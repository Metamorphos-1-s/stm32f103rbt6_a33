# Project stage status

## Stage 5A

Stage 5A HF2-R1 hardware regression is merged to `main` at
`167f4f43290dcfceccd7e510965b5e0b9445ef9` and tagged
`stage5a-hf2-r1-hw-tested` (`9d698a79d7cae1c92c74cfdaf6556b9e93ed8f6b`).

The persistent-dirty audit is recorded in
`Docs/STAGE5A_CLOSEOUT_CONFIG_DIRTY.md`: Schema V2 persists tare mass, TARE
and CLEAR TARE intentionally dirty the revision, and ZERO/RESET ZERO are
currently RAM-only zero-offset operations.

## Stage 5C-A

Branch: `stage5c-ble-a`.

This stage adds the nonblocking W02 UART transport and observable connection
manager on the existing USART1 resource. USART3 is not present in the current
CubeMX project, so no USART3 claim or `.ioc` change was made. W02 module model,
AT protocol, BLE service/characteristic UUIDs, and true phone-link reporting
remain unknown and explicitly unimplemented.

Current status: software implementation in progress/host verified; hardware
W02 UART and BLE link validation pending.

Post-change ARM resource snapshot:

- Debug: Flash 112,412 B, RAM 12,256 B.
- Release: Flash 61,000 B, RAM 12,264 B.
- BoardDiagnostics: Flash 110,172 B, RAM 12,256 B.
- Release load end is `0x0800EE47`, below `0x0801F000`; Schema V2 is 344 B and the existing
  config slots remain A `0x0801F000-0x0801F7FF`, B `0x0801F800-0x0801FFFF`.
